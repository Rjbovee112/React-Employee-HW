* PROJECT TITLE-EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This project was designed to manage employees and filter them based on their last name, if the are a Front/Back or Full-Stack developer.  The user has quick access to their employee information.  They are also able to see the employees full name, email and phone number so that they can contact said employee.

** GETTING STARTED

The user can search all the employees that work for them but last name, Front/Back and Full-Stack.  The sort by last name button is a single click button that will configure all the employees by last name.  

Sorting by Front/Back and Full will require the user to use the drop-down function to the right of “filter by”.  Those three options will then appear, and the user will then choose which option they would like to select.
